                <p>
                    I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student at UC Irvine.
                
                    I am currently a student who loves learning about computer science, more specifially AI and machine learning, but I am also interested in web development as well. 
                    I have a passion towards learning new things so I am open to learning more about all areas of computer science!
